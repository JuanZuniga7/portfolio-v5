            description: "Hello everyone! I'm Juan Zu√±iga, a programmer with over 4 years of experience, 3 of which have been dedicated to professional software development.\nDuring this time, I've been known for my proactivity, quick learning, and attention to detail when tackling problems and proposing solutions.\nI consider myself adept at sticking to development plans while remaining flexible enough to adapt to highly dynamic environments.\nI'm passionate about open-source software, though I wouldn't call myself a purist.\n\nI love spending my free time exploring new places, experiencing new things, and learning something new every day.\nI hail from the city of Santa Marta, Magdalena, in Colombia, where I've spent most of my life.",
